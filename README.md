# LLM-Assist-Clip

## Overview
LLM-Assist-Clip is a utility designed to simplify the process of preparing and transferring project files to large language models (LLMs). This tool automates the task of copying file contents to your clipboard in a structured format, making it easy for AI to parse and understand the code. Itâ€™s particularly useful for developers working with AI platforms that require manual input of code snippets or entire files.

## Features
- **Selective Recursive File Search**: Allows specification of file types for recursive directory search.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Formats and copies the content and names of files directly to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into any AI tool or text field.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tested on Linux; expected to work on macOS and Windows as well.

## External Libraries Used
- **[Clip](https://github.com/dacap/clip)**: A cross-platform library used for clipboard operations.

## Usage
To use LLM-Assist-Clip, compile and run the program from your terminal or command prompt with file extensions as arguments. The `-r` flag can be used to specify that subsequent file types should be searched for recursively:

### Command Syntax
```bash
./LAC [options] <file extensions>
```

### Options
- `-r`: Apply recursive search to file extensions listed after this flag.

### Examples
- Search for `.cpp` and `.h` files non-recursively, and for `.txt` and `.md` files recursively:
  ```bash
  ./LAC .cpp .h -r .txt .md
  ```
- Search for all specified file types recursively:
  ```bash
  ./LAC -r .cpp .h .txt
  ```

### Output Example
```
filename1.cpp:
<content of filename1.cpp>

filename2.h:
<content of filename2.h>

...
```

## Building the Project
1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iman-zamani/LLM-Assist-Clip.git
   cd LLM-Assist-Clip
   ```

2. **Initialize required submodules**:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Compile the application**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. **Run the application** by specifying the types of files you want to process, using the `-r` flag as needed for recursive search.

## Simple and Effective
This tool is crafted to minimize the typically involved friction in preparing and analyzing code with AI tools, providing a straightforward solution to meet essential needs without complicating the user experience.
